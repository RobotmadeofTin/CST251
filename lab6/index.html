	<h1> LAB 6 </h1>
	<h1> The Subject </h1>
	<p> The end goals are to "create an html file and then style it with a CSS file" </p>
	<h1> The STRUGGLE </h1>
	<p> We'll see, the night is young. The first contestant is when it comes to the forms in task 2.
	I want to figure out how to get them to display the word "username" and "pasword" inside of the boxes
but I don't think I will be figuring this out today. I FIGURED IT OUT! Placeholder attribute! I love
playing around! How do I make it an option to deselect a radio, and why doesn't placeholder or value work
with radios and checkboxes? I believe I shall leave this for tomorrow, because I like it when Prof Modes
explains what I am doing wrong. Either way they're there, just not as pretty as I wish they would be. How
to make them verticle as well. I played around with the CSS and I can't wait to learn more about it.
I couldn't figure out how to change font color, but this I won't ask because I assume we will learn
in the near future.</p>
	<h1> The Result </h1>
	<p>I think I did pretty well, everything is on here so...</p>

	<h1> The Egg and Cheese Breakfast Wrap </h1>
	<img src="img/eggandcheesewrap.jpeg" alt="Egg and Cheese Breakfast Wrap" height=200pi width=200pi>
	<p> The kids have been bringing home their lunches from school and I just KNEW I not let this opportunity go! So I am going to review them.
		<span class="Description"> The texture is horrible, the tortilla is rock hard but the eggs are always so soggy and rubbery. <span>
		<span class="Description"> The taste is even worse, you'd be lucky to have a condiment with you to cover up the taste of wet cardboard, sadly stale cheese, and watered down egg. <span>
		<span class+"Description"> The smell is the best part about it, because it's so stale it hardly smells. Of course if you get up close and personal, it smells... nauseating. <span>
