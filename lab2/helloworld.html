	<h1> Hello World </h1>

	<p> I don't remember much about my partner other than she seemed pretty cool,
	was the reason I reached out to be her partner in the first place! I really
like animals, at least anything besides ants and wasps.... I literally thought
of the movie "Antman and the Wasp" LMAOOOOOOO!!!!!! </p>

<div> Nothing is here because this is the lab I did teletype with my partner on </div>
