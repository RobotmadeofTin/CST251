				<p>The whole point is to successfully style a webpage with CSS </p>
			<h1> The STRUGGLE </h1>
				<p> Okay so new thing learned, I think you only link the style sheet in the heading,
					and not after every photo you link. Also, it has nothing to do with the lab, but
					it's a struggle. I've been on the verge of crying for absolutely no reason for the
					past 7 days and I do not appreciate it. I don't have time to schedule in 3 daily cries.
					linking my CSS file is not going well. I figured it out, changed it from lab.css to
					index.css and it all worked out. Margins were hard to figure out for a bit, but
					I think I got it now. Inspect on your own browser locally is amazing.
					I can't figure out borders at all, sizing or color. It's alright though
					because my page looks amazing regardless. It just sucks</p>
			<h1> The Result </h1>
