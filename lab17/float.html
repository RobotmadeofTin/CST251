	<article> I, I, when I was younger
I, I, should have known better
And I can't feel no remorse
And you don't feel nothing back
I, I, got a new girlfriend
She feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse
And you can't see past my blinders
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind girl since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help a fool who falls in love
I, I, got a little paycheck
You got big plans and you gotta move
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small
Honey I love you, that's all she wrote
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind girl like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help a fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind girl since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help a fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind girl like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help a fool who falls in love
