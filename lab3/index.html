		<h1> Figuring Out A New Language... Pt. 2 </h1>

		<p> So... I'll be honest, when I was first reading over the lab I was simply
	confused as to why there was a need for a partner...
	but I was so young.... so naive.... I would soon eat those words and a cup
	of dirt. It all started with task 2. Why task 2? Well that would be because
	task 1 was already done for us -see first image-. I admit having a template
	ready for me is helpful but I'm worried about the day I'll no longer be able
	to rely on them. Anyway! Task 2, we edit our personal page even further, add
	tabs to all of the labs even though you can direct yourself from within one
	link if you click the parent directory. The task was so new, so so new. A
	brand new language. It felt suffocating. I tackled the links first since
	there was a visual example of what it was supposed to look like. - I just
	realized there is no spell check on these. Gooefw. SEE, that was supposed to
	say goose! We should learn how to add spell check... somehow. Back to the
	blabber- This part was simple. But then I had to add the image -see image 2-
	to my HTML file and that is when everything fell apart. I could not for the
	life of me figure it out! Neither could my partner so I struggled for a bit
	and then struggled some more. I then gave up and finished linking my labs.
	-see image 3- and then my friend let me know of a solution that worked out
	for her and it worked for me and then I was ecstatic! Drag image into chrome
	and then copy that URL into the link for the source of the image. It came out
	good if I do say so myself but I didn't have the courage to
	play around with style when it had taken me so long to get my image to work.
	I mean, what if I messed up somehow and lost all of my progress. Coward move,
	but I'll become braver once I know the basics a bit more, so keep your
	judgements to a minimum. Afterwards I did the whole github thing and I
	realized the reason I couldn't commit a whole bunch of files at once was
	because of the summary. I'll do my best to remember that from now on! Oh, the
	picture of my current lab 3 browser viewer thing is also here -see images 4&5-.
