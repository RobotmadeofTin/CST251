		<div> The end goals are to make sure our files are working properly within
			the websites and to publish our websites. </div>
		<h1> The STRUGGLE</h1>
		<p> Oh man! Professor Modes said this was the easiest lab we'll have... HAHA!
			That's funny! Well I was given a false sense of comfort because I was
			immediately reminded of why so many people find coding to be tedious. One
			small mistake can mean an hour of debugging. So last lab I completely
			forgot the concept of directories and I had found another way to get the
			links and images to work but it just seemed so wrong so thankfully I asked
			the prof the next day and he reminded me of what I needed to do but then
			I still had to fix all of my past mistakes from last lab for this lab so.
			And then it became sort of my problem but not my problem because my partner
			had some issues with her website and nothing we tried out worked, we
			couldn't get to the bottom of it so she's getting help from a professional
			but, But, BUT we did -prepare for some corny words- and don't that just
			make your heart melt into a puddle! Friendship Building Opportnities! YAY!
			We love the results of our problem solving bonding experiences! </p>
		<h1> The Results</h1>
		<div> Eh, I got to the end goal, my partner didn't. But we did grow a bit
			and gained some knowledge today and that is what matters. So! Till next
			time! ADIOS! </div>
