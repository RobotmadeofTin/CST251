		<h1> Purpose </h1>
			<p> The Purpose of this lab was to use block-level and typography css
				to recreate a more complicated webpage </p>

		<h1> Challenges </h1>
			<p> There have been many, as expected. The first time around I created a
		 		new index for this lab I suffered immensly. Nothing was working, heck
				nothing I changed in inspeact was even showing up. So I deleted it and
				started over. This fixed the issue. Next it was spacing and alignment so
			 	I played around with margins, padding, and width. The largest problem
				I faced was getting the text to go over the image. I created a container
				for the background image, and spent a good amount of time continuing to
				to tinker around with padding and width. But the background image was
				not the only piece of the website that needed text on top. There was
				also a button that needed text on top of it and It took so much playing
				around with containers. I... I forfeit my right to being a possible
				web designer. I couldn't figure it out. W3schools didn't help either.
				I feel like a complete failure. I'm being dramatic. Then came the
				triangles down below at the end of the page and I'm pretty sure it's
				allowed but I ended up making the triangles an image that I stuck to
				the end of the "background".</p>
