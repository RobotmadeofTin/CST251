	<h1>Goal</h1>
		<p>To come up with rough sketches for the website my group will be working on.</p>

	<h1>challenges</h1>
		<p>These are rough sketches, but I'm worried they might be too simple. I mean
		that was technically the purpose of the website though, to be simple, yet
		aesthetically pleasing to the eye to attract viewership. It will all come
		down to the styling. I was too lazy to do each but calming, exhilirating, and
		must are all a standard design for the entire website that will require that
		website. It's not each page will have a different look, because that's not it.
		We want there to be a pattern. a connection.</p>

	<h1>Results</p1>
		<p> Well, it's a work in process of course but I think everything we have so
		far is coming along nicely. I can't wait to see what everyone else pitched so
		that we can come up with a design as a group </p>
