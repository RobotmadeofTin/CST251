	<h1>Goal</h1>
		<p>To come up with more detailed rough sketches for the website my group will
		be working on.</p>

	<h1>challenges</h1>
		<p>I wrote down my main wants of style on here, but I would have to talk to
		group if we want to implement these designs at all. I tried implementing their
		stuff but it just seems hard for me to do something as a merge of three styles.</p>

	<h1>Results</p1>
		<p> I can see the vision in my head now, can't you? </p>
