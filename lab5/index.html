		<h1> The Subject </h1>
		<div> This time our goal is to work towards creating a webpage with images
			and links to other pages. </div>
		<h1> The STRUGGLE </h1>
		<p> I have to play around with width and height when I'm inserting images.
			At the bare minimum, I know I should start off with 100 pixels instead
			of something larger and the work my way upward to larger numbers if need
			be. Is that it? Yeah, I guess so. Nope! Because I am having trouble
			linking the parent directory and I have no clue why???? I just am so...
			I cam up with a solution but I am 100% sure it's the wrong one. It was
			because copying the site link didn't work and neither did erasing the first
			two directories. I'm going to try the last one and if not, I'll just
			ask for a visual demonstration tomorrow. Hope I don't bother my bother
			classmates too much. Nope. I reall don't know what I'm doing wrong...
			update, changing it to lowercase didn't work either. Taking away the final
			directory away didn't work either. WHAT AM  DOING WRONNNNNNNNG?!?!?!?!?<p>
		<h1> The Results </h1>
		<div>	I was able to sucessfully create this webpage and I am very proud of
			myself! <div>
