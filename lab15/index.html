		<h1> Purpose </h1>
		<div> The end goals are to experiment with the fancy CSS we learned in lecture. </div>
		<h1> Challenges </h1>
		<p> Working with decoration has got to be my favorite thing ever in CSS! It was
		so fun to experiment and I think it helps that these protocals are probably
		among the very few things that I feel like I have a comfortable amount of knowledhe
		about. There was one thing though, and I don't think it's a challenge because
		I like the way it turned out, but when I played around with object-fit, it did
		it did something to my images, stacked them on top of each other. Adding on the
		rotation transform and I think it turned out really good! It's probably not what
		it's supposed to do though.</p>
		<h1> Results </h1>
		<p>You're looking at it! XD </p>
