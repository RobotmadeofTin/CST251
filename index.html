			<p>This page belongs to a homosapian... not a robot made of tin</p>
			<p> Some Info About Me: I'm 18. Middle name is Yadhira.
					I want to get a pet raccoon. Also a cat. I would like
					to volunteer at a rescue center once covid eases up and foster
					kittens in the future, once I'm out of college and have my own place.
			</p>
			<p> Some things I would look forward to in this class: I don't
					know anything about coding at all, so whatever I do end up
					learning is already amazing. I hope I learn the skills
					required to create a cool looking website though. I also
					highly doubt I'll learn it here, but if I could learn to
					HACK INTO something! AGHHHHHHHHH That would be freaking cool!
					Like insert some images of me into my friends photos without any
					context! If that's illegal -which it probably is- then I just
					want to clarify that I would never do that. This is on file now.</p>
			<p> It's the beginning of the fourth week 3:44am, I want to be able to
					place emojis into my website. </p>
