		<p>This page belongs to a homosapian... not a robot made of tin</p>
		<p> Some Info About Me: I'm 18. Middle name is Yadhira.
		I want to get a pet raccoon. Also a cat. I would like
	to volunteer at a rescue center once covid eases up and foster
kittens in the future, once I'm out of college and have my own place. </p>
		<p> Some things I would look forward to in this class: I don't
			know anything about coding at all, so whatever I do end up
			learning is already amazing. I hope I learn the skills
			required to create a cool looking website though. I also
			highly doubt I'll learn it here, but if I could learn to
			HACK INTO something! AGHHHHHHHHH That would be freaking cool!
			Like insert some images of me into my friends photos without any
			context! If that's illegal -which it probably is- then I just
			want to clarify that I would never do that. This is on file now.</p>
		<p> It's the beginning of the fourth week 3:44am, I want to be able to
			place emojis into my website. </p>
