    <p> "I am not the only traveler who has not repaid his debt. I've been searching
      for a trail to follow again. Take me back to the night we met. And then I can
       tell myself, what the hell am I supposed to do. And then I can tell myself:
        not to ride along with you. I had all and the most, some and now none of you."

      "It's about time that i got a happy end because Ive been waiting for you for
      a hundred days. It's like I'm touching you for the first very time, taste like
      cherries and taste like wine. Baby, oh you know you got me crazy, thinking about
      you on the daily... drinking every drop of your love. " -Call Me Loop </p>
