					My favorite quote is "fish are friends, not food" < that's not
					really true.

					The only time I ever sprained anything is when I slipped in mud. when
					I was 13...

					I asked my English class to honestly write down if they had done drugs,
					in front of the teacher herself. *facepalm*
				</br>
					I helped a cat give birth when she was having labor complications and
					It was during that small sliver of time that any accessible animal
					hospital was closed; immediately shut down thoughts of being a vet
					after that.
				</br>
					I don't like sushi- I KNOW! I gasped too when I realized -mostly with
					disgust but also with shock- although I don't know why I was so shocked
					either, I don't like seafood in general.
